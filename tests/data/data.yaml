      Dear Hiring Manager, or to whom it may concern,
    
      Please hire me. I work. A lot. Some say too much, but I think they are the
      ones who simply don’t like working... I mean, you can’t call yourself a hard
      worker and refuse to work on Sundays if your boss asks you to work on Saturdays.
      If they ask of you much, make sure you give them too much --- that’s my life
      philosophy.
      
      I’m also very attentive to details: I once set an out-of-office reply saying I
      would not be checking emails while on holiday. Then I spent most of the holiday
      checking whether it was working properly. I like to ensure everything runs like
      clockwork --- except for my sleep cycle, which is a long-lost battle, but
      nothing two cups of coffee in the morning can’t fix.
      
      I thrive under pressure, survive on caffeine, and only need to rest
      occasionally. If you need someone who will work weekends, holidays, and
      possibly in their dreams --- I am your person.
      
      I promise to bring unstoppable energy, a questionable work-life balance, and a
      genuine passion for making your company even greater and wealthier. Please,
      let me prove that exhaustion is just another word for "commitment."
      
      Eagerly --- and already working on this application overtime ---,\
      John B. Goode Workmann.
